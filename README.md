I recently joined as a **Machine Learning Engineer at M2M Tech**, where I build **agentic AI systems** designed to make education smarter, more personal, and adaptive. I love working at the intersection of **machine learning** and **full-stack development**, turning research ideas into real tools that help people learn better.  

I'm currently a student at **UBC**, and outside of my work, I spend a lot of time exploring the research side of AI reading papers on **model architectures, tokenization methods, and hallucination behavior in large language models**. I enjoy diving into how these systems actually work under the hood and how we can make them more reliable and interpretable.

### What I’m Working On
- **Prepleet** — an AI-powered interview practice site for computer science students  
- Building intelligent education agents that personalize learning experiences  
- Scaling and deploying ML systems using **AWS** (SageMaker, Lambda, ECS, Bedrock)
